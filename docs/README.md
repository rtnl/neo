# neo

neo is a modal shell program with an emphasis on consistency, versatility and transparency.
this project is a solution for a (finally) unified experience for virtually all platforms.

## features

see [features.md](./features.md)

## author's note

as of now, I'm thinking of leading this into something like a blend of tmux with native object support inspired from
powershell and fancy data display like nushell. I'll revise the feature set continuously as I work on the
implementation.
